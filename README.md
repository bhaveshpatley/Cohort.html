# Cohort.html

A collection of handwritten HTML/CSS/JavaScript programs created as part of coursework and assignments.

## About
This repository contains small web projects and assignment solutions. Each folder typically holds a single exercise or demo built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage
- To view a project, open its `index.html` file in your web browser.
- For a local web server (recommended for some features):
  - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Then open `http://localhost:8000/<project-folder>/`

## Repository structure
- `project-name/` — folder for a specific assignment (contains `index.html`, CSS, JS, assets)
- `README.md` — this file

## Contributing
If you want to add or update exercises:
1. Create a new folder named after the exercise.
2. Add the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any assets.
3. Open a pull request or ask me to commit changes.
